	<h1 class="text-3xl pb-4">Introduction</h1>
	<p>
		Greetings, and welcome to my digital abode! 
		My name is Nicolas, and I'm a Software Engineer who is deeply passionate about all things related to technology and coding. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I was born and raised in Germany, a nation renowned for its engineering prowess and innovative spirit â€” traits I aim to embody in my professional and personal life.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm currently employed as a Fullstack Engineer at <a class="link" href="https://www.arag.de">ARAG</a>, the industry-leading legal insurance company. 
		My role here is multi-faceted: not only do I get to dive deep into challenging engineering tasks, but I also have the honor of wearing the hat of an Instructor. 
		In this role, I mentor apprentices, offering them the guidance, knowledge, and hands-on experience they need to flourish in the fast-evolving world of software engineering. 
		There's a special kind of fulfillment in helping the next generation of engineers grow and prosper.

		Interests & Hobbies

	<p>
		When I'm not immersed in lines of code or tinkering with new technologies, I like to diversify my interests to keep a balanced life.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl flex gap-2 items-center">

		Coding
	</h2>

	<p>
		Yes, my job is also my hobby. 
		I often find myself lost in personal projects or contributing to open-source endeavors. 
		Whether it's building a new app or creating a library for public use, the process of transforming an idea into something functional is incredibly rewarding for me.

		Gym
	</h2>

	<p>
		Working out is not just a routine; it's a lifestyle choice for me. 
		Spending time at the gym helps me focus better and keeps my energy levels high. It's my form of active meditation.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl flex gap-2 items-center">
		<BoardgameIcon />
		Board Games
	</h2>

	<p>
		You'll often find me huddled around a board game with my friends. 
		It's not just about the competition; it's about strategizing, thinking ahead, and most importantly, having fun. 
		<!--From classics like "Settlers of Catan" to newer hits like "Codenames," I'm always eager to play.-->
	</p>

	<span class="divider"></span>

	<p>
		By combining my professional aspirations with my hobbies, I strive to lead a life rich in experiences and learning. 
		Whether I'm debugging code, lifting weights, or strategizing my way to victory in a board game, each activity offers its own set of challenges and rewards. 
		This multifaceted approach to life not only keeps things interesting but also contributes to making me a well-rounded individual.
